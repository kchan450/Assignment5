**Assignment 5: Toddler Project**

Objective
In this assignment, two datasets are merged to create a comprehensive table that includes both sales data and unit costs.

Nike Sales Dataset (Nike_sales_2024) – Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset contains Nike's global sales data for 2024. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushcx/nike-global-sales-data-2024)

Nike Unit Cost Dataset (Nike_unitcost) – it is generated from [www.mockaroo.com], providing unit cost for different Nike products.

By joining these datasets, a more detailed sales table that includes both sales figures and unit costs, enabling a deeper analysis of profit or pricing strategy for each country/month. Also, it can help to identify any potential discrepancies in the Cost Dataset.
