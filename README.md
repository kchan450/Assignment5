In this assignment, two datasets are merged to create a comprehensive table that includes both sales data and unit costs.

Dataset 1: Nike Sales Dataset (Nike_sales_2024) – Sourced from Kaggle, this dataset contains Nike's global sales data for 2024. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayushcx/nike-global-sales-data-2024), it is the one copied from Assignment 3

By joining these datasets, a more detailed sales table that includes sales figures as well as its related unit costs by each product line, enabling a deeper analysis of profit or pricing strategy for each country/month.
